## Predicted Interview Questions
Technical  
1. Walk me through your architecture for a complex React component library. How do you enforce reusability and type safety?  
2. How would you structure state management with Redux Toolkit vs. Context API vs. RxJS? Describe a real use case.  
3. Explain your TDD workflow: writing unit tests (Jest), integration tests (Testing Library), and E2E tests (Testcafe). How do you keep tests reliable?  
4. Describe your CI/CD pipeline: linting, build, test, deployment. How do you handle secrets, environment variables, and rollbacks?  
5. How would you implement a secure SSO flow (OAuth/OIDC) in a SPA? What are the risks and mitigation strategies?  

Behavioral & Collaboration  
6. Tell me about a time you mentored a junior developer. What challenges did you face, and how did you measure their growth?  
7. Describe a cross-team conflict (e.g., between Design and Engineering). How did you facilitate resolution?  
8. Give an example of a significant mistake in production. What did you learn and how did you prevent recurrence?  
9. How do you stay updated on frontend best practices and emerging technologies?  
10. Why on-site? How do you envision working in HENNGE’s English-first, physically collaborative environment?

## Questions to Ask Them
1. “What are the top three front-end initiatives for HENNGE One in the next 6–12 months?”  
2. “How does the team balance rapid feature development with strict security and compliance requirements?”  
3. “Can you walk me through your current process for code reviews, branching strategies, and release management?”  
4. “What tools or practices do you plan to adopt for frontend performance monitoring or micro-frontend architectures?”  
5. “How does HENNGE support continuous learning—beyond English lessons—and career growth for senior engineers?”  
6. “With the new Okta partnership, what frontend challenges or integrations are on the horizon?”  
7. “What are the biggest technical debts or legacy areas the front-end team is tackling right now?”  

## Concepts To Know/Review
- Advanced React patterns (Hooks, Context vs. Redux Toolkit, Suspense)  
- TypeScript generics, discriminated unions, utility types  
- Styled Components theming and style­lint integration  
- RxJS for complex async flows (error handling, memory leaks)  
- Unit & integration testing best practices (Jest, Testing Library)  
- E2E testing strategies with Testcafe (parallelization, flakiness mitigation)  
- CI/CD pipeline design (GitHub Actions syntax, caching, matrix builds, rollback)  
- OAuth2/OIDC flows, JWT security, CORS, CSP, XSS prevention in SPAs  
- AWS deployment for static SPAs (S3, CloudFront, environment config)  

## Strategic Advice
Tone & Focus  
- Be **concise and structured**: answer STAR-style for behavioral and TL;DR at the top for technical deep dives.  
- Demonstrate **ownership**: reference past end-to-end feature deliveries and how you drove them.  
- Emphasize **mentorship**: cite specific examples of guiding juniors, improving code quality, running workshops.  
- Highlight **customer and security focus**: show understanding of secure UI patterns and HENNGE One’s enterprise users.  

Red Flags & Watch Outs  
- If interviewers offer vague answers on tech debt, ask follow-ups—this indicates where you can add immediate value.  
- Gauge their CI/CD maturity: if they lack automated tests or pipelines, position yourself as the one to lead that initiative.  
- Confirm on-site expectations: ensure alignment on working hours, Japanese language support, and relocation logistics.  

Close Strong  
- Reiterate enthusiasm for HENNGE’s mission: *liberating technology securely*  
- Connect your **growth trajectory**: share how you envision progressing into lead or architect roles, aligning with HENNGE’s career frameworks.  

Good luck, Juan! You’re set to make a confident, well-informed impression—and to demonstrate you’re the front-end leader HENNGE needs.
